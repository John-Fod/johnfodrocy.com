				<h1>John Fodrocy <span>Software Developer</span></h1>
				<p class="description">I am a Tokyo based software developer with experience
				working in several object oriented languages and web technologies. After teaching
				English for seven years, I decided to make the jump to software and earned my
				computer science degree from Oregon State University with a GPA of 3.78. I am eager
				to get into the professional world and start working on exciting software.</p>

								<p class=Description>This is one of my later projects I worked on
								while earning my degree. It is made with some of the first technologies
								I learned to work with, but It also incorporates some more difficult
								things like asynchronous requests and calls to an API. Also, this was a
								group project, so it was important to communicate and write code that
								could be easily understood.</p>

								It makes heavy use of HTML5's canvas element and JavaScript. It is

                    This is a multiplayer space combat game I'm working on. Right now,
                    its front end is being developed using React while the back end
                    is a Ruby on Rails powered API. In the future, I hope to use this
                    API to make mobile front ends.
